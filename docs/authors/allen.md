Natalie Allen is a PhD candidate and NSF graduate research fellow at Johns Hopkins University, working with Dr. Néstor Espinoza and Prof. David Sing. She is interested in the observation and characterization of exoplanet atmospheres for planets of all sizes, as well as the disentanging of stellar contamination signals from said atmospheric observations. She is working on a retrieval framework to utilize Pandora’s long observations of noisy stars to model multiple contaminated transmission spectra simultaneously, using each transit as a “snapshot” of the star to build a persistent stellar surface to phase and evolve in order to maximize the chance of unearthing the underlying planet’s signal.
