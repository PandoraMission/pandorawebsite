Mr. Trevor Foote is a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate at Cornell University and NASA FINESST fellow, working with Prof. Nikole Lewis. His research interests include characterization of exoplanet atmospheres, especially toward the goal of identifying potentially habitable planets and detecting bio-signatures. He is also interested in detector development for use in the analysis of these far-off worlds. While working as a job shadow for Pandora’s Deputy Project Scientist, Tom Barclay, Trevor has worked on development of a 2D image simulator for the near-IR detector and the creation of the mission’s observation scheduler. His current project for Pandora includes the development and execution of characterization testing for the near-IR detector and the creation of data reference products for use in the data processing pipeline.
