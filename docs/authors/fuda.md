Fuda Nguyen is a graduate student working with Prof. Daniel Apai at the Lunar & Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona and a science team member of Pandora. Fudaâ€™s work focuses on exoplanet atmospheres and understanding their evolution with time-resolved observation. His current work utilizes TESS data to assess rotational modulation of brown dwarfs and infer potential atmospheric morphologies. He is excited with the prospect of using Pandora to study ultracool atmospheres, particularly the nature of polar vortices and zonal circulation on these atmospheres with simultaneous spectrophotometry enabled by Pandora.
