Ben Hord is a PhD candidate at the University of Maryland, College Park and will transition to a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in support of the Pandora Mission in September 2023. He works primarily with TESS data, modeling photometric time series as well as detecting, validating, and characterizing planets with a particular focus on hot Jupiters. In addition to planet detection and characterization, Ben also works on prioritizing targets for follow up atmospheric observations with JWST and other observatories. As a team member on Pandora, he supports the identification of prime targets for the observatory and will contribute to the mission’s data processing pipeline.
