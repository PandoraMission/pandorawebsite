Dr. Aishwarya Iyer is a NASA Postdoctoral Fellow at Goddard Space Flight Center. Her research focuses on stellar atmospheric characterization, acquiring fundamental properties of low mass stars. She also has expertise in retrievals and Gaussian Process based inference techniques. She is also interested in stellar surface heterogeneities and their influence on planetary atmospheric properties. For Pandora science, she will contribute with a robust stellar characterization modeling framework to effectively decouple interaction signals with planetary data in order to ultimately understand planetary atmospheres.
