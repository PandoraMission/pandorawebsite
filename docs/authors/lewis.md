Nikole K. Lewis is an Exoplanetary Scientist and Associate Professor in the Department of Astronomy at Cornell University. Professor Lewisâ€™ work focuses on probing exoplanet atmospheres using a combination of observational and theoretical techniques. Her current research includes work with both space- and ground-based campaigns to measure spectra and photometry of exoplanet atmospheres as well as the development of one-, two-, and three-dimensional models to guide and interpret those observations. She is also interested in laboratory work that provides constraints on key atmospheric processes such as cloud and haze formation and the development of instrumentation for facilities that aim to characterize exoplanets and their environs.
