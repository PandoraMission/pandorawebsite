Nikole Lewis is an expert in the area of exoplanet characterization. She has suc- cessfully bridged the gap between theory and observation through her pioneering work with Spitzer, Hubble, and JWST exoplanet observations and the development of associated modeling and analysis tools. Her current research includes work with both space- and ground-based campaigns to measure spectra and photometry of exoplanet atmospheres as well as the development of one-, two-, and three-dimensional atmospheric models to guide and interpret those observations.
