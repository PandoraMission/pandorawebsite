Megan Weiner Mansfield is an Assistant Professor at the University of Maryland. Meganâ€™s research focuses on the spectroscopic characterization of exoplanet atmospheres to study planetary formation, physics, chemistry, and habitability. She uses a variety of ground-based and space-based observatories including Hubble, JWST, and the Gemini telescopes. She uses a variety of ground-based and space-based observations to study planetary formation, physics, chemistry, and habitability. Megan received her PhD from the University of Chicago in 2021, where she performed spectroscopic observations and modeling of highly irradiated exoplanets, ranging in size from hot terrestrial planets to ultra-hot Jupiters.
