Ben is a Research Scientist at MIT, working on the detection and characterization of transiting exoplanets. He is interested primarily in small exoplanets around nearby small stars that afford the best opportunities for detailed atmospheric characterization, including searches for biosignatures with near-future telescopes. Starspots can mimic or mask atmospheric features in transmission spectra, and so he also studies new approaches for constraining stellar photospheric heterogeneity and disentangling stellar and planetary signals in transmission spectra.
