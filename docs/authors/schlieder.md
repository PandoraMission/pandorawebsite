Joshua Schlieder is a Research Astrophysicist in the Exoplanets and Stellar Astrophysics Laboratory at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. His roles include Wide Field Instrument Scientist for the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope and Operations Project Scientist for the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Josh's research interests fall under the broad headings of time-domain astronomy, stellar astrophysics, and exoplanets. He uses time series photometry to understand stellar rotation and flares, identify and characterize transiting exoplanets, and study other transient phenomena. His most recent work involves direct exoplanet and disk imaging observations with the NIRCam instrument on the JWST and preparing for science from Roman's large surveys.
