Stellar brightness variations due to star spots and faculae, however, can contaminate these measurements. Pandora's goal is to disentangle star and planet signals in transmission spectra to reliably determine exoplanet atmosphere compositions. This is broken into two goals: Determine the spot and faculae covering fractions of low-mass exoplanet host stars and the impact of these active regions on exoplanetary transmission spectra. Identify exoplanets with hydrogen- or water-dominated atmospheres, and determine which planets are covered by clouds and hazes. Pandora will observe at least 20 exoplanets over long durations (~10 transits per planet) with sizes ranging from Earth-size to Jupiter-size and host stars spanning mid-K to late-M spectral types. What is Pandora The Pandora SmallSat was selected as an inaugural NASA Astrophysics Pioneers mission in 2021, and it will launch in 2025 as a secondary payload in Sun-synchronous low-Earth orbit. It consists of a 0.45-meter telescope and instrumentation for simultaneous near-infrared spectroscopy and visible-light photometry. These wavelengths will provide constraints on the spot and faculae covering fractions of low-mass exoplanet host stars and the impact of these active regions on exoplanetary transmission spectra. SmallSats are incredibly valuable for developing the next generation of space mission leaders. By design, Pandora has a diverse team, with over half of the mission leadership roles filled by early-career scientists and engineers. Pandora schedule The Pandora mission will complete the science objectives proposed, archive the data, and publish results within a 5-year timeline. Launch would occur in the mid-2020s, although the precise timeline is dependent on a ride-sharing agreement. Pandora is expected to operate concurrently with JWST. JWST has four science instruments with modes for observing transiting exoplanets to high precision and longer IR wavelengths; however, stellar contamination will persist for JWST transmission spectra. We anticipate the opportunity for simultaneous observations in which JWST will do short-baseline deep dives and Pandora will provide long-baseline and visible-band observations. Pandora Payload The Pandora payload is built around an all-aluminum 0.45-m Cassegrain telescope design. The telescope is designed to address the challenge of procuring high-performing imaging space systems in a ride-sharing form-factor that are low cost and have rapid acquisition. To help address these challenges, the telescope design minimizes space-vehicle dependencies and maximizes customizability of the aft optics to accommodate a variety of optical configurations. Compared to traditional glass optics, aluminum telescopes are more suited to large-scale manufacturing and batch production. Combined with mechanical interfaces that are machined in parallel with optical surfaces, the telescope has a significant cost- and schedule- advantage over other designs.

This list will be published here as the list is finalized. Target Selection Methodology The Pandora Science Team developed a set of criteria and metrics for selecting the best set of exoplanetary targets to not only meet the mission\u2019s requirements but to maximize the science output of Pandora\u2019s prime mission. These metrics incorporate current knowledge about the observatory\u2019s capabilities as well as the science questions that the mission seeks to answer. The planetary systems composite tables on the NASA Exoplanet Archive serve as the base of the target list, from which all targets and their information are gathered. This list is then limited to transiting planets only as well as planets with orbital periods < 18 days around host stars with effective temperatures of < 5300 Kelvin. The restriction in planet orbital period ensures that a sufficient number of transits are observable over Pandora\u2019s year-long mission lifetime for each planet target. An upper limit of 5300 K ensures that the target list captures the full range of M- and K-dwarf stars. The magnitude of the host stars is also limited to 7.0 < J < 11.5 and H < 11.0 in order to prevent targets from saturating Pandora\u2019s detectors. In order to help prioritize which exoplanets Pandora should observe, the Transmission Spectroscopy Metric (TSM, Kempton, et al. 2018 ) is computed for each planet meeting the above criteria. This metric provides an indicator of how strong of a spectral signal a planet\u2019s atmosphere would provide relative to that of other planets. The TSM follows the equation: \\[ TSM = (Scale factor) \\times \\frac{R^{3}_{p}T_{eq}}{M_{p}R^{2}_{*}} \\times 10^{-m_{J}/5} \\] where \\(R_{p}\\) is the radius of the planet in units of Earth radii, \\(M_{p}\\) is the mass of the planet in units of Earth masses, \\(R_{*}\\) is the radius of the host star in units of Solar radii, \\(m_{J}\\) is the apparent magnitude of the host star in J band, the scale factor is a normalization constant to scale the metric to JWST simulations performed by Louie, et al. 2018 , and \\(T_{eq}\\) is the planet\u2019s equilibrium temperature in Kelvin calculated for zero albedo and full day-night heat redistribution according to \\[ T_{eq} = T_{*}\\sqrt{\\frac{R_{*}}{a}}\\left( \\frac{1}{4} \\right)^{1/4} \\] where \\(T_{*}\\) is the host star effective temperature in Kelvin and \\(a\\) is the orbital semi-major axis given in the same units as \\(R_{*}\\) . The TSM provides a good indicator of how observable a planet\u2019s atmospheric features will be, but Pandora also aims to measure the stellar activity of a diverse range of host stars. Therefore, the Pandora Science Team developed a separate Signal Detection Metric (SDM) to incorporate stellar rotational variability into the target list prioritization. The SDM is defined as \\[ SDM = TSM \\times (1+wA) \\] where TSM is the transmission spectroscopy metric as stated above, \\(A\\) is the peak-to-peak amplitude of variability, and \\(w\\) is a weighting factor such that a \\(w\\) of 100 effectively doubles the metric for a star with \\(A\\) =1%. All exoplanets that meet the observational restrictions are ranked by SDM to produce the target lists shown here. The planets with the top 20 SDM values make up the primary targets list and those with the 21st-40th best SDM values make up the secondary target list.","title":"Target List"},{"location":"targets/#pandora-targets","text":"","title":"Pandora Targets"},{"location":"targets/#target-list","text":"The current list of science targets is given below (as of July 30, 2025).

In this series of posts, we'll be telling you the story of the mission from its conception through development, and all the way through launch and the first science results. Our goal is to record the journey of Pandora, while demystifying the process and effort of designing a NASA mission for early career scientists, and showcasing our amazing science team. Thanks for reading, and feel free to direct any questions to us on twitter, @briles_34 or @aussiastronomer! \u200b\u200b Astronomers have their eye on exoplanets --- and an upcoming mission, known as Pandora, would help provide them with a clearer view. Right now, stars' active, changing surfaces are one of the biggest challenges for observing exoplanet atmospheres. Pandora is a small satellite mission that will observe exoplanets as they transit in front of their host stars, looking in multiple colors to help disentangle the effects of the star from the information about the exoplanet's atmosphere. As part of NASA's Pioneers program , Pandora is currently under development and is looking to launch in the mid-2020s. In this first installment, we present an interview from Pandora Archive Scientist Jessie Christiansen with Deputy Project Scientist Tom Barclay and science team member Josh Schlieder , discussing how the mission got started in the first place. Archive Scientist Jessie Christiansen Deputy Project Scientist Tom Barclay science team member Josh Schlieder Today's interviewer and guests. Left to Right: Jessie Christiansen, Tom Barclay, and Josh Schleider. Jessie: So, for posterity, this is the first interview in our series of Pandora pedagogical, behind-the-scenes blog posts, where we're going to interview all of the members of the Pandora team and find out how they got involved and how the mission came to be. This is interview one with Tom Barclay and Joshua Schlieder! Tom: Hello, my name is Tom Barclay. I'm based at NASA Goddard . I work on Pandora amongst other missions, but my role on Pandora is that I'm a scientist in charge of instrument and observatory design. And I work with engineers to make sure that Pandora will meet the requirements that the scientists need. I call myself a deputy project scientist for Pandora. Josh: My name is Josh Schlieder. I'm an astrophysicist at NASA Goddard. I work on several missions, Pandora being one of them. I also work on the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope , and I work on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory . Officially, I'm a member of the Pandora science team, and I help with things like target selection, and thinking about how we observe these targets in a way to achieve our science. And behind the scenes, also sort of, you know, just contributing to technical discussions. Jessie: Can you tell us about the first discussions that ended up leading to the idea for Pandora? Was it a science question you were thinking about? Or was there a technological development that made something new and interesting? What was the initial spark that started things? Tom: I guess to step back, both of us and Elisa Quintana [Pandora Principal Investigator] and Knicole Colon [Pandora Project Scientist] joined Goddard at almost precisely the same time, which was fabulous...there was a lot of new energy in the place. The primary purpose that Goddard exists is that Goddard does flight projects, so when you start there, people are like: so do you have any mission ideas? I don't think any of us had ever worked anywhere like that, so coming up with our own flight project was something that wasn't realistic to us. But we were just kind of bouncing ideas off each other. And obviously, I think what we wanted to do is something exoplanet related. But we weren't exactly sure what that was. We thought about ideas of which things you can do uniquely from space: you can measure your long observing times, you can measure much more precisely, you can measure in the infrared , you can measure in the ultraviolet . And so thinking of ideas like these was kind of what started our conversations...I think Pandora specifically happened because Josh was like, \"Hey, stellar activity could be a real problem for exoplanet science for NASA because we're putting a lot of science eggs into the basket of transmission spectroscopy with JWST . As we move forward with that, are the results trustworthy? And is there something we could do, anything that could help with this experiment?\" To look at transmission spectra in the infrared, and do it precisely, you need to be in space --- so that's where the idea was initially formulated. It was a lot of hallway conversations that led to it. Jessie: Yeah, that's really interesting that the whole thing started with the question: if you could do something in space, what would you do? I think that's probably not an opportunity that a lot of people genuinely get handed regularly --- especially early career people who might be interested in these interviews. Josh, did you have anything you wanted to add? Josh: I think I think Tom covered all of it pretty well, and with a lot of detail and things I actually can't remember. But yeah, in general, I can add that he and I and Elisa and Knicole all coming together around the same time and having mutual interest in exoplanets, and particularly transiting exoplanets, led to us sort of realizing that there was a real opportunity to get together and think about what kind of mission we can do to solve some outstanding problems. I went into Elisa's office with his [Ben Rackham's] paper, and I was like, \"Have you seen this? Have you read this?\" And she was like, \"No, I mean, I've heard of it. But I haven't really looked into it.\" I remember we started drawing stuff on the whiteboard and talking through it and being like, this is a problem, like this is going to be a big deal...we decided, \"Oh, well, maybe this is a science topic we could pursue through this opportunity.\" And exoplanet science was really what brought us together and got us brainstorming these kinds of things. Jessie: From there, how did you get the ball rolling on actually creating the mission? What were your next steps between taking this problem that you had identified and sitting down with someone and saying, \"Hey, let's make this happen\"? Tom: Relatively quickly, we, you know, we hit upon the idea of kind of simultaneous observations of multiple colors. Because no one else is doing that. And it's one way that we could tackle this issue [of stellar activity in transmission spectra] and collect data no one else was collecting. Josh: We had a conversation with someone on the mission development side of things at NASA, and we pitched this idea and what the science was. What we thought we needed to do, like Tom said, is to take both blue and red observations of a star while the planet is transiting. In the blue, we get what the star is doing, and then the red sort of tells us what the planet is doing. And if you have both at the same time, then you can disentangle them, and you've sort of solved this contamination problem --- because you've got a record of each individual thing at the same time, and you can pull apart the pieces. The way the missions happen within NASA --- for what we would call a small or a modest sized mission --- is a competed call , where you have to apply and write a proposal. They [the mission development experts] wanted to know things like, \"What proposal call are you going to propose to? Which calls are coming up in the future? Could you fit this mission concept into that type of call and that type of cost cap?\" All those questions were thrown at us, and we were like, \"It's just an idea!\" After we got that feedback from people who had way more experience than we did, we had to really sit down and talk about what we needed --- what size of telescope, what kinds of instrumentation, what kind of orbit, how many targets and what targets, and what length of mission operation lifetime to really achieve the science. It's a very, very difficult process and it requires creative thinking and a lot of dedicated hard work. I guess we didn't get discouraged by the harsh reality of how this process goes upfront, and we just kept pushing on it. Eventually, in our discussions, we came up with a baseline idea, and Elisa Quintana came forward to lead the whole thing, then we went from there. Tom: I still have one of the first pictures we drew--- our first idea of what our instrument would look like. It was just a schematic of a mirror, with light coming in, hitting your mirror and then hitting a dichroic [a crystal that splits light into two colors] and going up to two detectors. Jessie: Yeah, that's all it really is. Right? Tom: That's basically what we're building. I mean, obviously many, many hundreds of hours of engineering work went into taking that piece of paper and turning it into something real. But that basic idea was kind of the spark. After me and Joshua were bouncing around the first ideas, we decided to write an internal proposal. Goddard has this internal proposal call, called an IRAD . It's where you ask for some funds to do something --- they're normally very limited, but they're enough to kickstart a project. We asked for money for some engineering development time to work with engineers to flesh out our ideas into a real mission concept, and that got people interested. Josh: It's actually a really sort of incredible process when you think about it, because we came to Goddard in early 2017, sort of talking amongst ourselves thinking about a science question we can answer. We weren't discouraged by the difficult reality of what we were up against. And maybe that was our naivete. That was helping us because we didn't really know what we were up against. We just sort of dove in, taking opportunities as they came. Going from a sketch on a whiteboard of a mirror to actually having a CAD model of a telescope and an instrument and thinking about what components you would select, and how would they fit together --- it all happened very fast, in months. If you have a good idea, and you get some momentum behind it, it can quickly go really far. Jessie: It seems like the fact that you guys had access to this \"kickstarter\" funding was really pivotal. For people out there who might be reading these posts and thinking they've got an idea, and they're really excited - what's the way forward for them? Would you say come come chat to people at a NASA center? Tom: We did manage to get some internal funds that gave us the kickstart. We went through NASA Goddard's selection process of what missions they want to push forward, at the same time the Explorers mission call was happening. Explorers is a call for proposals every two years, and they solicit a range of mission sizes, and sometimes small missions of opportunity. We went through that process as a small mission of opportunity. In the government ranking, I think we were ranked 2nd --- which means they officially approved us to move forward, but they didn't actually have any funding for us. A huge credit should go to Elisa for pushing this forward. She led the other proposals and the IRAD, and even without any money or engineering support, she was like, \"We're not done, we're going to find a way to push this forward.\" She went on a mission to find someone else to pay for it, and managed to get a contract with Lawrence Livermore National Lab . They said they had a telescope for us, but it's bigger than we were expecting --- 45 centimeters instead of 20. We were like, we can deal with the bigger telescope! Jessie: So this is four times the original collecting area? How much has the idea for the mission changed from your original discussions to what ended up being proposed for and selected? Josh: Actually, the bigger telescope opened up an opportunity for us. When we upgraded to that larger collecting area, we actually gained access to more targets and had more choice of what we could actually do in terms of a science program. Tom: I mean, the biggest change was, we thought we could cram everything into a 12U CubeSat . Josh: Yeah, when we upgraded, we went from the idea of having a relatively large CubeSat to having a relatively small full-payload-plus-bus kind of combination, which is what we typically see for a larger space telescope. I would say, the design that we ended up with for Pandora when Elisa built a partnership with Lawrence Livermore is more akin to what you would have proposed as a small Explorer-class mission 10 years ago. Now, it can fit into this small mission of opportunity size class because of technological advancements and the availability of components and, you know, progress marching forward. Jessie: So, once you partnered with Lawrence Livermore, did you still propose to the small mission of opportunity program ? Tom: Yeah, so we had to write this proposal extremely quickly. Long story short, that didn't get accepted, but we got pretty good feedback. We looked for our next opportunity, which ended up being the new Pioneers mission call . We were like --- can we take this $35 million mission and squeeze it into a $20 million cost box? It might seem totally insane, but there's also a big difference in risk management in these two mission types. The small mission of opportunity was a high fidelity, high risk management project, but the Pioneers required less so we could drop a lot of overhead in terms of management and risk. Jessie: Ah, so you didn't have to have a, you know, high heritage space unicorn ready to go. You could have a horse with a horn on. Tom: Yeah, exactly. We had to drop a few things here and there. But it's basically the same mission we proposed. Jessie: Ah, well, that's actually the next question on my list. Were there any hard decisions that had to be made? Are there any that you regret deeply? What are you sad that you don't have? Tom: What do you think, Josh? Josh: I don't know. I was hoping you could have something insightful to say for this question, because I don't remember anything that we necessarily were sad about giving up. Jessie: (jokingly) One of the things you gave up was a paid archive service, because now I'm just doing it for free. Josh: Actually, one of the unfortunate things is that the hardware costs what it costs, and you have to have engineering support to build and test the hardware before you fly it. And so if you're looking at a cost crunch, then what ends up taking a hit is often the time of people on the science side. And that's really unfortunate, but it's the reality that I think a lot of NASA missions face when they're in development. Jessie: Yeah, Pandora is definitely not the first mission to experience this. Tom: I was gonna say, Pandora has had one kind of interesting quirk of what we're able to do there, though, because the Pioneers call very explicitly talks about training the next generation of spaceflight leaders. So it focuses on earlier career folks. The fact that we're allowed to take more risks, and we're looking at early career people, means that we could put people in positions in the mission that in a different class mission, people would be surprised --- like, okay, does this person really have the experience to do that job? Whereas in this, we can say, \"No, they are the right person to do this job for this mission! And if they don't have the experience, they sure as hell will get it now.\" Jessie: Oh, that's interesting. Okay, now that you are deep in the work of the mission, are you glad that you had the idea for Pandora? Josh: Yeah, enthusiastically yes, I would say. It's what we're here for, to be honest. It's why we want to work in the place where we work, and why we want to do the things we do --- to, you know, have these ideas and work together with an awesome team of people. This is sort of what we signed up to do. And here we are doing it. It's really a thrill to think that something that we came up with the idea for is now, you know, being supported to be built and flown to go to space and do science. Tom: Right? Yeah, it's the coolest thing about being able to try and build something and put it in space, it's the coolest thing you can imagine. Jessie: What advice do you have for early career astronomers and planetary scientists who have their own ideas for mission? Josh: Talk to people that are your colleagues and that have different experiences. Sort of socialize the idea and see what the feedback is, and take the feedback seriously. I mean, there might be somebody who says,\"Oh, that's a terrible idea, I would never, I would never support such a thing.\" But that is just one opinion. And people have lots of those. And so, you know, I would say, embrace your ideas. Tom: I exactly agree with Josh, that you need a level of confidence in your idea that initial setbacks aren't going to push you back. But your first idea probably isn't a very good one, or at least your initial way of solving it. Certainly, everything that me and Josh, at least, have tried to do, the initial ideas have been fatally flawed, but there are ways of kind of bouncing them around moving in certain directions, so that you can come up with something feasible. Jessie: Right? Even if your first idea doesn't work, the fact that you're having ideas is already exciting, right? Like coming up with something is already cool --- like well done, you, and just because that idea didn't work doesn't mean you won't have other ideas. Tom: The thing that made Pandora successful is that the science question was important and interesting and got people's attention right away. And I think successful missions all have that fundamental foundation, that the science idea is solid. Josh: I would add, something that I've certainly learned along this path is you absolutely cannot do this on your own. You have to build a team. And, you know, building that team is part of the struggle but also part of the fun in doing this. Jessie: All right, last question. What are you most excited about for the next phases of the mission? Tom: I mean, I've been theoretically designing what this instrument is going to be and what it's going to look like and coming up with what the data is going to be like. And the next phase is we're going to start with buying components, we're putting them together, we're testing things. Josh: You know, I've been just infatuated with rocket launches. And so I'm really looking forward to the day when Pandora is built and tested and put together and it's attached to some rocket and where we're just sitting there counting down and waiting to see that happen.","title":"The Beginnings of Pandora"},{"location":"blogposts/blogpost1/#the-beginnings-of-pandora","text":"June 9th 2022 Author: Briley Lewis We present an interview from Pandora Archive Scientist Jessie Christiansen with Deputy Project Scientist Tom Barclay and science team member Josh Schlieder Welcome to the first blog post of the Pandora mission ! In this series of posts, we'll be telling you the story of the mission from its conception through development, and all the way through launch and the first science results. Our goal is to record the journey of Pandora, while demystifying the process and effort of designing a NASA mission for early career scientists, and showcasing our amazing science team. Thanks for reading, and feel free to direct any questions to us on twitter, @briles_34 or @aussiastronomer! \u200b\u200b Astronomers have their eye on exoplanets --- and an upcoming mission, known as Pandora, would help provide them with a clearer view. Right now, stars' active, changing surfaces are one of the biggest challenges for observing exoplanet atmospheres. Pandora is a small satellite mission that will observe exoplanets as they transit in front of their host stars, looking in multiple colors to help disentangle the effects of the star from the information about the exoplanet's atmosphere. As part of NASA's Pioneers program , Pandora is currently under development and is looking to launch in the mid-2020s. In this first installment, we present an interview from Pandora Archive Scientist Jessie Christiansen with Deputy Project Scientist Tom Barclay and science team member Josh Schlieder , discussing how the mission got started in the first place. Archive Scientist Jessie Christiansen Deputy Project Scientist Tom Barclay science team member Josh Schlieder Today's interviewer and guests. Left to Right: Jessie Christiansen, Tom Barclay, and Josh Schleider. Jessie: So, for posterity, this is the first interview in our series of Pandora pedagogical, behind-the-scenes blog posts, where we're going to interview all of the members of the Pandora team and find out how they got involved and how the mission came to be. This is interview one with Tom Barclay and Joshua Schlieder! Tom: Hello, my name is Tom Barclay. I'm based at NASA Goddard . I work on Pandora amongst other missions, but my role on Pandora is that I'm a scientist in charge of instrument and observatory design. And I work with engineers to make sure that Pandora will meet the requirements that the scientists need. I call myself a deputy project scientist for Pandora. Josh: My name is Josh Schlieder. I'm an astrophysicist at NASA Goddard. I work on several missions, Pandora being one of them. I also work on the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope , and I work on the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory . Officially, I'm a member of the Pandora science team, and I help with things like target selection, and thinking about how we observe these targets in a way to achieve our science. And behind the scenes, also sort of, you know, just contributing to technical discussions. Jessie: Can you tell us about the first discussions that ended up leading to the idea for Pandora? Was it a science question you were thinking about? Or was there a technological development that made something new and interesting? What was the initial spark that started things? Tom: I guess to step back, both of us and Elisa Quintana [Pandora Principal Investigator] and Knicole Colon [Pandora Project Scientist] joined Goddard at almost precisely the same time, which was fabulous...there was a lot of new energy in the place. The primary purpose that Goddard exists is that Goddard does flight projects, so when you start there, people are like: so do you have any mission ideas? I don't think any of us had ever worked anywhere like that, so coming up with our own flight project was something that wasn't realistic to us. But we were just kind of bouncing ideas off each other. And obviously, I think what we wanted to do is something exoplanet related. But we weren't exactly sure what that was. We thought about ideas of which things you can do uniquely from space: you can measure your long observing times, you can measure much more precisely, you can measure in the infrared , you can measure in the ultraviolet . And so thinking of ideas like these was kind of what started our conversations...I think Pandora specifically happened because Josh was like, \"Hey, stellar activity could be a real problem for exoplanet science for NASA because we're putting a lot of science eggs into the basket of transmission spectroscopy with JWST . As we move forward with that, are the results trustworthy? And is there something we could do, anything that could help with this experiment?\" To look at transmission spectra in the infrared, and do it precisely, you need to be in space --- so that's where the idea was initially formulated. It was a lot of hallway conversations that led to it. Jessie: Yeah, that's really interesting that the whole thing started with the question: if you could do something in space, what would you do? I think that's probably not an opportunity that a lot of people genuinely get handed regularly --- especially early career people who might be interested in these interviews. Josh, did you have anything you wanted to add? Josh: I think I think Tom covered all of it pretty well, and with a lot of detail and things I actually can't remember. But yeah, in general, I can add that he and I and Elisa and Knicole all coming together around the same time and having mutual interest in exoplanets, and particularly transiting exoplanets, led to us sort of realizing that there was a real opportunity to get together and think about what kind of mission we can do to solve some outstanding problems. I went into Elisa's office with his [Ben Rackham's] paper, and I was like, \"Have you seen this? Have you read this?\" And she was like, \"No, I mean, I've heard of it. But I haven't really looked into it.\" I remember we started drawing stuff on the whiteboard and talking through it and being like, this is a problem, like this is going to be a big deal...we decided, \"Oh, well, maybe this is a science topic we could pursue through this opportunity.\" And exoplanet science was really what brought us together and got us brainstorming these kinds of things. Jessie: From there, how did you get the ball rolling on actually creating the mission? What were your next steps between taking this problem that you had identified and sitting down with someone and saying, \"Hey, let's make this happen\"? Tom: Relatively quickly, we, you know, we hit upon the idea of kind of simultaneous observations of multiple colors. Because no one else is doing that. And it's one way that we could tackle this issue [of stellar activity in transmission spectra] and collect data no one else was collecting. Josh: We had a conversation with someone on the mission development side of things at NASA, and we pitched this idea and what the science was. What we thought we needed to do, like Tom said, is to take both blue and red observations of a star while the planet is transiting. In the blue, we get what the star is doing, and then the red sort of tells us what the planet is doing. And if you have both at the same time, then you can disentangle them, and you've sort of solved this contamination problem --- because you've got a record of each individual thing at the same time, and you can pull apart the pieces. The way the missions happen within NASA --- for what we would call a small or a modest sized mission --- is a competed call , where you have to apply and write a proposal. They [the mission development experts] wanted to know things like, \"What proposal call are you going to propose to? Which calls are coming up in the future? Could you fit this mission concept into that type of call and that type of cost cap?\" All those questions were thrown at us, and we were like, \"It's just an idea!\" After we got that feedback from people who had way more experience than we did, we had to really sit down and talk about what we needed --- what size of telescope, what kinds of instrumentation, what kind of orbit, how many targets and what targets, and what length of mission operation lifetime to really achieve the science. It's a very, very difficult process and it requires creative thinking and a lot of dedicated hard work. I guess we didn't get discouraged by the harsh reality of how this process goes upfront, and we just kept pushing on it. Eventually, in our discussions, we came up with a baseline idea, and Elisa Quintana came forward to lead the whole thing, then we went from there. Tom: I still have one of the first pictures we drew--- our first idea of what our instrument would look like. It was just a schematic of a mirror, with light coming in, hitting your mirror and then hitting a dichroic [a crystal that splits light into two colors] and going up to two detectors. Jessie: Yeah, that's all it really is. Right? Tom: That's basically what we're building. I mean, obviously many, many hundreds of hours of engineering work went into taking that piece of paper and turning it into something real. But that basic idea was kind of the spark. After me and Joshua were bouncing around the first ideas, we decided to write an internal proposal. Goddard has this internal proposal call, called an IRAD . It's where you ask for some funds to do something --- they're normally very limited, but they're enough to kickstart a project. We asked for money for some engineering development time to work with engineers to flesh out our ideas into a real mission concept, and that got people interested. Josh: It's actually a really sort of incredible process when you think about it, because we came to Goddard in early 2017, sort of talking amongst ourselves thinking about a science question we can answer. We weren't discouraged by the difficult reality of what we were up against. And maybe that was our naivete. That was helping us because we didn't really know what we were up against. We just sort of dove in, taking opportunities as they came. Going from a sketch on a whiteboard of a mirror to actually having a CAD model of a telescope and an instrument and thinking about what components you would select, and how would they fit together --- it all happened very fast, in months. If you have a good idea, and you get some momentum behind it, it can quickly go really far. Jessie: It seems like the fact that you guys had access to this \"kickstarter\" funding was really pivotal. For people out there who might be reading these posts and thinking they've got an idea, and they're really excited - what's the way forward for them? Would you say come come chat to people at a NASA center? Tom: We did manage to get some internal funds that gave us the kickstart. We went through NASA Goddard's selection process of what missions they want to push forward, at the same time the Explorers mission call was happening. Explorers is a call for proposals every two years, and they solicit a range of mission sizes, and sometimes small missions of opportunity. We went through that process as a small mission of opportunity. In the government ranking, I think we were ranked 2nd --- which means they officially approved us to move forward, but they didn't actually have any funding for us. A huge credit should go to Elisa for pushing this forward. She led the other proposals and the IRAD, and even without any money or engineering support, she was like, \"We're not done, we're going to find a way to push this forward.\" She went on a mission to find someone else to pay for it, and managed to get a contract with Lawrence Livermore National Lab . They said they had a telescope for us, but it's bigger than we were expecting --- 45 centimeters instead of 20. We were like, we can deal with the bigger telescope! Jessie: So this is four times the original collecting area? How much has the idea for the mission changed from your original discussions to what ended up being proposed for and selected? Josh: Actually, the bigger telescope opened up an opportunity for us. When we upgraded to that larger collecting area, we actually gained access to more targets and had more choice of what we could actually do in terms of a science program. Tom: I mean, the biggest change was, we thought we could cram everything into a 12U CubeSat . Josh: Yeah, when we upgraded, we went from the idea of having a relatively large CubeSat to having a relatively small full-payload-plus-bus kind of combination, which is what we typically see for a larger space telescope. I would say, the design that we ended up with for Pandora when Elisa built a partnership with Lawrence Livermore is more akin to what you would have proposed as a small Explorer-class mission 10 years ago. Now, it can fit into this small mission of opportunity size class because of technological advancements and the availability of components and, you know, progress marching forward. Jessie: So, once you partnered with Lawrence Livermore, did you still propose to the small mission of opportunity program ? Tom: Yeah, so we had to write this proposal extremely quickly. Long story short, that didn't get accepted, but we got pretty good feedback. We looked for our next opportunity, which ended up being the new Pioneers mission call . We were like --- can we take this $35 million mission and squeeze it into a $20 million cost box? It might seem totally insane, but there's also a big difference in risk management in these two mission types. The small mission of opportunity was a high fidelity, high risk management project, but the Pioneers required less so we could drop a lot of overhead in terms of management and risk. Jessie: Ah, so you didn't have to have a, you know, high heritage space unicorn ready to go. You could have a horse with a horn on. Tom: Yeah, exactly. We had to drop a few things here and there. But it's basically the same mission we proposed. Jessie: Ah, well, that's actually the next question on my list. Were there any hard decisions that had to be made? Are there any that you regret deeply? What are you sad that you don't have? Tom: What do you think, Josh? Josh: I don't know. I was hoping you could have something insightful to say for this question, because I don't remember anything that we necessarily were sad about giving up. Jessie: (jokingly) One of the things you gave up was a paid archive service, because now I'm just doing it for free. Josh: Actually, one of the unfortunate things is that the hardware costs what it costs, and you have to have engineering support to build and test the hardware before you fly it. And so if you're looking at a cost crunch, then what ends up taking a hit is often the time of people on the science side. And that's really unfortunate, but it's the reality that I think a lot of NASA missions face when they're in development. Jessie: Yeah, Pandora is definitely not the first mission to experience this.

There are many steps to making a NASA mission happen, and one of the first is proposing \u2014 submitting a formal description of the idea and plans to be considered for funding. In our second installment, we present an interview from Pandora Archive Scientist Jessie Christiansen with Pandora Principal Investigator (PI) Elisa Quintana , discussing the process of proposing the mission now known as Pandora .

In this series of blog posts, we\u2019ll be telling you the story of the mission from its conception through development, and all the way through launch and the first science results. Our goal is to record the journey of Pandora, while demystifying the process and effort of designing a NASA mission for early career scientists, and showcasing our amazing science team. Thanks for reading, and feel free to ask any questions or leave any comments below! Jessie : Can you describe your first conversations with Tom [Barclay] and Josh [Schleider] about what would become Pandora ? When did the idea first come to you? Elisa : Josh and Tom described [in the last interview post] how we got some seed funding to do some initial investigations. One of our mottos [at NASA Goddard ] is that \u201cGoddard starts with science\u201d \u2014 so, that was the case for this mission as well. We were interested in the prospects for long-duration observations of exoplanets with spectroscopy, and came across studies on stellar contamination by Daniel Apai and Ben Rackham . These studies inspired us to think more about the influence of the stars on this technique, andwhat it would take to help answer some of these outstanding questions. We knew JWST was going to have infrared observations, so we asked ourselves \u2014 what could we answer if we had simultaneous observations in optical or UV? We knew the science questions we wanted to answer, so the first step [towards Pandora ] was trying to understand what measurements would be needed. Jessie : When did you first start to get excited about Pandora , like as an idea, and as an actual way to address this problem? When did you first think, \u201cOh, this could really work!\u201d? Elisa : At Goddard, we're surrounded by a lot of people who are working on mission concepts from small, tiny missions and balloons to large flagships . Straight away, we heard that if we were interested in pursuing this idea, there were resources for this kind of thing \u2014 some internal at Goddard, and some external, like at JPL . NASA has a mission planning lab at Wallops , which is for small missions. And they also have an instrument / mission design lab. One thing I noticed at Goddard was, even though they've done lots and lots of missions, there's not a cookie cutter recipe or program to get you along - it always starts with something like, \u201cYou should call Bob over in Building 14, then talk to Steve over here.\u201d There's a lot of little things, and you have to tailor what you do to your mission idea. And there are a lot of different resources you have to find. For Pandora , we got excited pretty early on. We had heard that there were some seed funding opportunities that were more towards technology development, but we tried to request some for some mission concept development instead. We got enough support to do an abbreviated mission planning workshop. Jessie : How do people usually get access to a workshop like the Wallops mission planning lab? Elisa : One way to do it is with a recently started proposal call for astrophysics, called AS3 . It\u2019s Astrophysics\u2026 Something Something. Jessie : Something Something *Something*, obviously. Elisa : It's a proposal to get funding to develop a proposal. You get something like $100k to flesh out a concept that could go into a proposal. Kind of like pre-work before you would think about putting in a mission proposal. Jessie : Okay, so the fact that people were really excited and receptive and willing to support the idea was when you were like, \u201cOh, this could be real, this could turn into something!\u201d Elisa : Yeah. And I mean, for every idea that that pans out, there are many, many more that don\u2019t. Our center can't support everyone that has an idea, so there\u2019s competition at every level. You want to go with the smallest scope and the smallest proposal possible. Jessie : You're not coming into it being like, \u201cWhat's the smallest thing I can propose for?\u201d Instead, it\u2019s: \u201cWhat's the smallest thing I can propose that gets me the answer to my question?\u201d Elisa : Yeah! I guess, to take a step back, every SMD [Science Mission Directorate] division has their own proposal programs, with different scopes of proposal calls. For example, astrophysics has SmEx (Small Explorers) and MidEx (Medium-Class Explorers) calls that alternate every few years. Planetary science has Discovery missions and New Frontiers . Then NASA headquarters recently developed the Pioneers program for astrophysics since they saw a gap between the smallest SmallSats /CubeSats and Small Missions of Opportunity (SMOOs), and the Explorer-Class missions. Jessie : It was a circuitous process before Pandora eventually landed in the Pioneers call. Can you talk about the different calls, how they were different, and how the idea had to change to fit into each box? Elisa : When we were originally proposing Pandora , we were looking at a CubeSat, roughly between the size of a Cheerio box and a microwave. We initially proposed for the SMOO, and we did the abbreviated mission planning lab. The mission planning lab was probably the most fun I've had so far in this whole thing, because you go in a room with different engineers that have different expertise. You go \u201cthis is my science idea!\u201d with a rough sketch of what you think you can do, they ask a bunch of questions, and we collect a bunch of information on what size and orbit and other things we need. By the time you leave, you have a concept that's feasible, or you don't. They said that we didn\u2019t have enough volume in a CubeSat to do what we needed, so they recommended we break out into an ESPA Grande [a larger, modular type of fairing] to accommodate the payload. But we still submitted to the SMOO. We submitted it on time, it went through the review process, and we were not selected. We did get feedback - in our case, the panel felt like the technical and management and cost side were really robust. And then the science was good, but not as robust. Usually, when projects get selected, they\u2019ve gone through several iterations of proposals. So, it wasn't surprising that we weren't selected because it's the first time we put it in. Kepler is a classic example \u2014 PI Bill Borucki put that proposal in over and over again for decades! I have even more respect for his commitment to that. After proposing once, you kind of want to throw your proposal in the trash and be done with it, because you're so over it. So, we took a break - we were really burnt out. Then, the Pioneers program call was announced. Our first thoughts were that it was a different scope - it was a $20 million dollar cost-cap [compared to a $35 million dollar cost-cap for the SMOO]. Nearly half of our original budget. However, it was being run under the Research and Technology program, not the space missions side of things. The requirements were different, and in particular the amount of money we had to have kept as \u201creserve\u201d was smaller, so we kept finding things to cut to get under the cost cap. It\u2019s like \u2014 the smaller the program, the higher risk and lower reserves NASA is allowed to take, and this was a smaller program. So, we actually didn't have to downsize the scope of our design. The biggest cost savings was stripping away the required reserves and stripping away the required overhead with project management. So we were able to just fit the project in that budget! Jessie : So then you rewrote the proposal for Pioneers? Elisa : Yeah! We had to develop a baseline mission \u2014 what you want to do to meet your goals \u2014 and a threshold mission. The threshold is asking yourself what the bare minimum is that makes the mission even worth doing. We submitted it, and we had no idea how it would do. Jessie : Do you know how many were submitted that first round? Elisa : I actually do. Jessie : One question that I just thought of \u2014 at what point did you decide you wanted to be PI? How did it feel to be PI of a selected mission? Elisa : It started out early on, when I was PI to get internal funding. Tom and Josh were involved in other larger projects at the same time we got started. Eventually, with Pandora in the Pioneers call, we got a phone call from Mike Garcia, the program manager, who said that the proposal was really well received and they\u2019d send us more information. We were surprised! After going through the first round, we felt that we couldn\u2019t really predict what a proposal panel was going to do or what they\u2019d think of our idea. After the SMOO call, the panel did tell us some of our \u201cPotential Major Weaknesses\u201d to give us a chance to correct them and I think that prepared us for the second time around. Jessie : A fun question for you - where did the name \u2018Pandora\u2019 come from? Did it ever have another name? Elisa : It wasn\u2019t always called that. One of the names we had thought of was Panterra, like the heavy metal band, but with two Rs. Then, when it was a CubeSat, Tom said, \u201cWell, what about Pandora\u2019s box, since it\u2019s a cube?\u201d The more we thought about it, the more we began to associate it with things like Earth and fire. Jessie : Okay but, remember the original story - isn\u2019t it bad that Pandora's box gets opened? That's where all the bad things come from! Elisa : Yeah, but I think it's also secrets that we're going to understand! *both laugh* Jessie : To wrap up, do you have any general advice for someone starting out and thinking about their own proposal? Elisa : I think it helps to reach out to people who have done missions before. I think now we\u2019re in a better time since there are opportunities like the PI Launchpad . And, it\u2019s fun. I think I'm at a stage in my career where I'm happy with my students and postdocs doing the science work, and I do management. I like budgets\u2026 when they work out. It's very gratifying when you can reconcile budgets and make a mission happen!

Author: Jessie Christiansen. There are many steps to making a NASA mission happen, and one of the first is proposing \u2014 submitting a formal description of the idea and plans to be considered for funding. In our second installment, we present an interview from Pandora Archive Scientist Jessie Christiansen with Pandora Principal Investigator (PI) Elisa Quintana , discussing the process of proposing the mission now known as Pandora .

In this series of blog posts, we\u2019ll be telling you the story of the mission from its conception through development, and all the way through launch and the first science results. Our goal is to record the journey of Pandora, while demystifying the process and effort of designing a NASA mission for early career scientists, and showcasing our amazing science team. Thanks for reading, and feel free to ask any questions or leave any comments below! Jessie : Can you describe your first conversations with Tom [Barclay] and Josh [Schleider] about what would become Pandora ? When did the idea first come to you? Elisa : Josh and Tom described [in the last interview post] how we got some seed funding to do some initial investigations. One of our mottos [at NASA Goddard ] is that \u201cGoddard starts with science\u201d \u2014 so, that was the case for this mission as well. We were interested in the prospects for long-duration observations of exoplanets with spectroscopy, and came across studies on stellar contamination by Daniel Apai and Ben Rackham . These studies inspired us to think more about the influence of the stars on this technique, andwhat it would take to help answer some of these outstanding questions. We knew JWST was going to have infrared observations, so we asked ourselves \u2014 what could we answer if we had simultaneous observations in optical or UV? We knew the science questions we wanted to answer, so the first step [towards Pandora ] was trying to understand what measurements would be needed. Jessie : When did you first start to get excited about Pandora , like as an idea, and as an actual way to address this problem? When did you first think, \u201cOh, this could really work!\u201d? Elisa : At Goddard, we're surrounded by a lot of people who are working on mission concepts from small, tiny missions and balloons to large flagships . Straight away, we heard that if we were interested in pursuing this idea, there were resources for this kind of thing \u2014 some internal at Goddard, and some external, like at JPL . NASA has a mission planning lab at Wallops , which is for small missions. And they also have an instrument / mission design lab. One thing I noticed at Goddard was, even though they've done lots and lots of missions, there's not a cookie cutter recipe or program to get you along - it always starts with something like, \u201cYou should call Bob over in Building 14, then talk to Steve over here.\u201d There's a lot of little things, and you have to tailor what you do to your mission idea. And there are a lot of different resources you have to find. For Pandora , we got excited pretty early on. We had heard that there were some seed funding opportunities that were more towards technology development, but we tried to request some for some mission concept development instead. We got enough support to do an abbreviated mission planning workshop. Jessie : How do people usually get access to a workshop like the Wallops mission planning lab? Elisa : One way to do it is with a recently started proposal call for astrophysics, called AS3 . It\u2019s Astrophysics\u2026 Something Something. Jessie : Something Something *Something*, obviously. Elisa : It's a proposal to get funding to develop a proposal. You get something like $100k to flesh out a concept that could go into a proposal. Kind of like pre-work before you would think about putting in a mission proposal. Jessie : Okay, so the fact that people were really excited and receptive and willing to support the idea was when you were like, \u201cOh, this could be real, this could turn into something!\u201d Elisa : Yeah. And I mean, for every idea that that pans out, there are many, many more that don\u2019t. Our center can't support everyone that has an idea, so there\u2019s competition at every level. You want to go with the smallest scope and the smallest proposal possible. Jessie : You're not coming into it being like, \u201cWhat's the smallest thing I can propose for?\u201d Instead, it\u2019s: \u201cWhat's the smallest thing I can propose that gets me the answer to my question?\u201d Elisa : Yeah! I guess, to take a step back, every SMD [Science Mission Directorate] division has their own proposal programs, with different scopes of proposal calls. For example, astrophysics has SmEx (Small Explorers) and MidEx (Medium-Class Explorers) calls that alternate every few years. Planetary science has Discovery missions and New Frontiers . Then NASA headquarters recently developed the Pioneers program for astrophysics since they saw a gap between the smallest SmallSats /CubeSats and Small Missions of Opportunity (SMOOs), and the Explorer-Class missions. Jessie : It was a circuitous process before Pandora eventually landed in the Pioneers call. Can you talk about the different calls, how they were different, and how the idea had to change to fit into each box? Elisa : When we were originally proposing Pandora , we were looking at a CubeSat, roughly between the size of a Cheerio box and a microwave. We initially proposed for the SMOO, and we did the abbreviated mission planning lab. The mission planning lab was probably the most fun I've had so far in this whole thing, because you go in a room with different engineers that have different expertise. You go \u201cthis is my science idea!\u201d with a rough sketch of what you think you can do, they ask a bunch of questions, and we collect a bunch of information on what size and orbit and other things we need. By the time you leave, you have a concept that's feasible, or you don't. They said that we didn\u2019t have enough volume in a CubeSat to do what we needed, so they recommended we break out into an ESPA Grande [a larger, modular type of fairing] to accommodate the payload. But we still submitted to the SMOO. We submitted it on time, it went through the review process, and we were not selected. We did get feedback - in our case, the panel felt like the technical and management and cost side were really robust. And then the science was good, but not as robust. Usually, when projects get selected, they\u2019ve gone through several iterations of proposals. So, it wasn't surprising that we weren't selected because it's the first time we put it in. Kepler is a classic example \u2014 PI Bill Borucki put that proposal in over and over again for decades! I have even more respect for his commitment to that. After proposing once, you kind of want to throw your proposal in the trash and be done with it, because you're so over it. So, we took a break - we were really burnt out. Then, the Pioneers program call was announced. Our first thoughts were that it was a different scope - it was a $20 million dollar cost-cap [compared to a $35 million dollar cost-cap for the SMOO]. Nearly half of our original budget. However, it was being run under the Research and Technology program, not the space missions side of things. The requirements were different, and in particular the amount of money we had to have kept as \u201creserve\u201d was smaller, so we kept finding things to cut to get under the cost cap. It\u2019s like \u2014 the smaller the program, the higher risk and lower reserves NASA is allowed to take, and this was a smaller program. So, we actually didn't have to downsize the scope of our design. The biggest cost savings was stripping away the required reserves and stripping away the required overhead with project management. So we were able to just fit the project in that budget! Jessie : So then you rewrote the proposal for Pioneers? Elisa : Yeah! We had to develop a baseline mission \u2014 what you want to do to meet your goals \u2014 and a threshold mission. The threshold is asking yourself what the bare minimum is that makes the mission even worth doing. We submitted it, and we had no idea how it would do. Jessie : Do you know how many were submitted that first round? Elisa : I actually do. Jessie : One question that I just thought of \u2014 at what point did you decide you wanted to be PI? How did it feel to be PI of a selected mission? Elisa : It started out early on, when I was PI to get internal funding. Tom and Josh were involved in other larger projects at the same time we got started. Eventually, with Pandora in the Pioneers call, we got a phone call from Mike Garcia, the program manager, who said that the proposal was really well received and they\u2019d send us more information. We were surprised! After going through the first round, we felt that we couldn\u2019t really predict what a proposal panel was going to do or what they\u2019d think of our idea. After the SMOO call, the panel did tell us some of our \u201cPotential Major Weaknesses\u201d to give us a chance to correct them and I think that prepared us for the second time around. Jessie : A fun question for you - where did the name \u2018Pandora\u2019 come from? Did it ever have another name? Elisa : It wasn\u2019t always called that. One of the names we had thought of was Panterra, like the heavy metal band, but with two Rs. Then, when it was a CubeSat, Tom said, \u201cWell, what about Pandora\u2019s box, since it\u2019s a cube?\u201d The more we thought about it, the more we began to associate it with things like Earth and fire. Jessie : Okay but, remember the original story - isn\u2019t it bad that Pandora's box gets opened? That's where all the bad things come from! Elisa : Yeah, but I think it's also secrets that we're going to understand! *both laugh* Jessie : To wrap up, do you have any general advice for someone starting out and thinking about their own proposal? Elisa : I think it helps to reach out to people who have done missions before. I think now we\u2019re in a better time since there are opportunities like the PI Launchpad . And, it\u2019s fun. I think I'm at a stage in my career where I'm happy with my students and postdocs doing the science work, and I do management. I like budgets\u2026 when they work out.
